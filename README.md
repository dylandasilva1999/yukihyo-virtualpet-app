<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## Project Description

According to an article posted by Team Wanderlust, the snow leopard was listed at number eight out of the 10 most endangered animals in the world. I chose the snow leopard to bring awareness to one of the most beautiful and unique animal species in the world.

The Snow Leopard according to an article on Treehugger stated that in 2017 the status changed from endangered to vulnerable, which caused the decrease in the population by major threats such as "Habitat Loss", “Poaching”, “Decline in Prey”, “Competition With Lifestock”, “Retaliatory Killing" and finally ”Climate Change”.

Yukihyo, is a virtual pet application to inform users on the impact climate change and poachers have on endangered animals such as the snow leopard, and encourage users to be aware about these dangers.
